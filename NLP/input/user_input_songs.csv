ABBA,Ahe's My Kind Of Girl,/a/abba/ahes+my+kind+of+girl_20598417.html,"Look at her face, it's a wonderful face  
And it means something special to me  
Look at the way that she smiles when she sees me  
How lucky can one fellow be?  
  
She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine  
Who could ever believe that she could be mine?  
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue  
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?  
  
And when we go for a walk in the park  
And she holds me and squeezes my hand  
We'll go on walking for hours and talking  
About all the things that we plan  
  
She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine  
Who could ever believe that she could be mine?  
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue  
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?

ABBA,"Andante, Andante",/a/abba/andante+andante_20002708.html,"Take it easy with me, please  
Touch me gently like a summer evening breeze  
Take your time, make it slow

Just let the feeling grow  
  
Make your fingers soft and light  
Let your body be the velvet of the night  
Touch my soul, you know how

Go slowly with me now  
  
I'm your music

Andante, Andante  
Tread lightly on my ground

Oh please don't let me down

Like the feeling of a thousand butterflies  
Please don't talk, go on, play  
Andante, Andante  
And let me float away  
  
I'm your music

ABBA,As Good As New,/a/abba/as+good+as+new_20003033.html,"I'll never know why I had to go  
Why I had to put up such a lousy rotten show  
Boy, I was tough, packing all my stuff  
Saying I don't need you anymore, I've had enough  
And now, look at me standing here again 'cause I found out that  
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma my life is here  
Gotta have you near  
  
As good as new, my love for you  
And keeping it that way is my intention  
As good as new and growing too  
Yes, I think it's taking on a new dimension  
It's as good as new, my love for you  
Just like it used to be and even better  
As good as new, thank God it's true  
Darling, we were always meant to stay together  
  
Feel like a creep, never felt so cheap  
Never had a notion that my love could be so deep  
How could I make such a dumb mistake  
Now I know I'm not entitled to another break  
But please, baby, I beg you to forgive 'cause I found out that  
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma my life is here  
Gotta get you near  
  
I thought that our love was at an end but here I am again  
  
As good as new, my love for you  
And keeping it that way is my intention  
As good as new and growing too  
Yes, I think it's taking on a new dimension  
It's as good as new, my love for you  
Just like it used to be and even better  
As good as new, thank God it's true  
Darling, we were always meant to stay together  
  
Yes the love I have for you feels as good as new  
Darling, we were always meant to stay together

ABBA,Bang,/a/abba/bang_20598415.html,"Making somebody happy is a question of give and take  
You can learn how to show it so come on, give yourself a break  
Every smile and every little touch  
Don't you know that they mean so much  
Sweet sweet kisses so tender  
Always will return to sender  
  
Like a bang, a boom-a-boomerang  
Dum-be-dum-dum be-dum-be-dum-dum  
Oh bang, a boom-a-boomerang  
Love is a tune you hum-de-hum-hum  
So give it away, I think you'll learn  
You'll get love in return  
So bang, a boom-a-boomerang is love  
A boom-a-boomerang is love  
  
Love is always around and you can look for it anywhere  
When you feel that you've found it my advice is to take good care  
Never use it as a selfish tool  
Never ever be such a fool  
Every feeling you're showing  
Is a boomerang you're throwing  
  
Yes a bang, a boom-a-boomerang  
Dum-be-dum-dum be-dum-be-dum-dum  
Oh bang, a boom-a-boomerang  
Love is a tune you hum-de-hum-hum  
So give it away, I think you'll learn  
You'll get love in return  
So bang, a boom-a-boomerang is love  
  
And if you're warm and tender  
I'll kiss you, return to sender  
Please surrender  
  
Bang, a boom-a-boomerang  
Dum-be-dum-dum be-dum-be-dum-dum  
Oh bang, a boom-a-boomerang is love  
A boom-a-boomerang is love

ABBA,Burning My Bridges,/a/abba/burning+my+bridges_20003011.html,"Well, you hoot and you holler and you make me mad  
And I've always been under your heel  
Holy christ what a lousy deal  
Now I'm sick and tired of your tedious ways  
And I ain't gonna take it no more  
Oh no no - walkin' out that door  
  
Burning my bridges, cutting my tie  
Once again I wanna look into the eye  
Being myself  
Counting my pride  
No un-right neighbour's gonna take me for a ride  
Burning my bridges  
Moving at last  
Girl I'm leaving and I'm burying the past  
Gonna have peace now  
You can be free  
No one here will make a sucker out of me

"
ABBA,Cassandra,/a/abba/cassandra_20002811.html,"Down in the street they're all singing and shouting  
Staying alive though the city is dead  
Hiding their shame behind hollow laughter  
While you are crying alone on your bed  
  
Pity Cassandra that no one believed you  
But then again you were lost from the start  
Now we must suffer and sell our secrets  
Bargain, playing smart, aching in our hearts  
  
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood  
Now the last day is dawning  
Some of us wanted but none of us would  
Listen to words of warning  
But on the darkest of nights  
Nobody knew how to fight  
And we were caught in our sleep  
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe  
You really had the power  
I only saw it as dreams you would weave  
Until the final hour  
  
So in the morning your ship will be sailing  
Now that your father and sister are gone  
There is no reason for you to linger  
You're grieving deeply but still moving on  
  
You know the future is casting a shadow  
No one else sees it but you know your fate  
Packing your bags, being slow and thorough  
Knowing, though you're late, that ship is sure to wait  
  
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood  
Now the last day is dawning  
Some of us wanted but none of us would  
Listen to words of warning  
But on the darkest of nights  
Nobody knew how to fight  
And we were caught in our sleep  
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe  
You really had the power  
I only saw it as dreams you would weave  
Until the final hour  
  
I watched the ship leaving harbor at sunrise  
Sails almost slack in the cool morning rain  
She stood on deck, just a tiny figure  
Rigid and restrained, blue eyes filled with pain  
  
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood  
Now the last day is dawning  
Some of us wanted but none of us would  
Listen to words of warning  
But on the darkest of nights  
Nobody knew how to fight  
And we were caught in our sleep  
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe  
You really had the power  
I only saw it as dreams you would weave  
Until the final hour  
  
I'm sorry Cassandra  
I'm sorry Cassandra

ABBA,Chiquitita,/a/abba/chiquitita_20002978.html,"Chiquitita, tell me what's wrong  
You're enchained by your own sorrow  
In your eyes there is no hope for tomorrow  
How I hate to see you like this  
There is no way you can deny it  
I can see that you're oh so sad, so quiet  
  
Chiquitita, tell me the truth  
I'm a shoulder you can cry on  
Your best friend, I'm the one you must rely on  
You were always sure of yourself  
Now I see you've broken a feather  
I hope we can patch it up together  
  
Chiquitita, you and I know  
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving  
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end  
You will have no time for grieving  
Chiquitita, you and I cry  
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you  
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita  
Try once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita  
  
So the walls came tumbling down  
And your love's a blown out candle  
All is gone and it seems too hard to handle  
Chiquitita, tell me the truth  
There is no way you can deny it  
I see that you're oh so sad, so quiet  
  
Chiquitita, you and I know  
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving  
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end  
You will have no time for grieving  
Chiquitita, you and I cry  
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you  
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita  
Try once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita  
Try once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita

ABBA,Crazy World,/a/abba/crazy+world_20003013.html,"I was out with the morning sun  
Couldn't sleep, so I thought I'd take a walk  
I was thinking of you and me  
And I went to your house, 'cause I had to talk  
  
I could hardly believe my eyes  
When I saw this guy closing your front door  
Had the feeling of emptiness like I never had before  
And I closed my eyes, will you leave me girl  
  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world  
As he disapeared in his car  
I was stunned and I didn't know what to do  
Everything I had ever dreamed  
  
Everything in my life's part of you  
And I just couldn't move my feet  
So I stood on the pavement as you came out  
You acted as you didn't know what it was all about  
  
And I closed my eyes, will you leave me girl  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world  
Baby, how could you do it  
You just told me lies  
  
And you meet behind my back  
With other guys  
Baby, how could you tell me  
There was only me  
  
I was stupid to believe you  
I was blind but now I see  
Then you smiled and you took my hand  
""There is something"", you said, ""that you may not know  
  
There's a couple of men in my life  
And one of them is my brother Joe  
He's been gone for a long, long time  
But he's back and I think he's gonna stay  
  
You'll be seeing a lot of him, he's so nice in every way""  
Then I closed my eyes, never leave me girl  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world  
So I closed my eyes, never leave me girl  
  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world  
So I closed my eyes, never leave me girl  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world

I start to see a picture  
Of a lonely man  
So clearly now reaching out for me

user name,I feel you,link,"I feel you in these walls
You're a cold air creeping in
Chill me to my bones and skin
I heard you down the hall
But it's vacant when I'm looking in
Oh, who let you in?
You walk around like you own the place
But you never say anything
I caught you walking straight through my walls
Guess it was all my fault
I think I let you in

Look, you said I never wrote a song for you
So I hope this one is haunting you
You said even if it took forever
That me and you would be together
And I never thought that you would lie
So I admit I took advantage of your precious time
I admit I took advantage of you every night that I was on the road
Even at home I wouldn't do you right !! !"

Trying to read the world today and see where you're at
I'll never do that
I'm a model that is uncomplicated
You can play a happy tune on me, but don't turn me off

I'm standing on a beach in the distance
And even though you're far away, can you see my red light?
It's waiting to turn green
'Cause I feel so isolated without you
I can't play a happy tune on my own, so stay by my side
High or low tide

High tide, high tide, high tide, high tide
High tide, high tide, high tide, high tide, high
