# Project Name

## Lyrics Analyser

# Abstract

There are millions of songs out there. However, only a handful of them can be considered popular. Can we build a system that can predict whether a song can be popular based on it's lyrics? Using advanced NLP and ML techniques, we think this is possible. This tool would have a significant impact on aspiring song writers.

The project is based on natural language processing over the existing lyrical dataset of over 5000+ popular songs and then using machine learning algorithms to generate a prediction model for guessing popularity of new songs based on keywords extracted from the lyrical dataset. The prediction model will be based upon the data extracted from already hit songs and will try to estimate the popularity of new songs based upon songâ€™s length, repetition of words, usage of pop culture keywords. 

We have utilized an open source dataset from Kaggle website, consisting of 5000+ popular hit songs from various genres and timescale. The data consists of many variables like performing artist, genre, total word length, year of release. Through, natural language processing we are extracting key features to prepare our dataset which will be used by machine learning algorithms. Some of the key features in our cleaned dataset are "most often used words", "average length" etc. 
We have used knn algorithm, random forest, linear regression, logistic regression to generate a prediction model which will conclude whether a provided lyrics could be popular or not. 

We have developed a website for aspiring song writers. They can register to our system and can view their past searched lyrics. We are also providing visualisation to users based on the cleaned dataset which will help users in deciding which words to include while writing lyrics. It will also help them in gaining insights into behavior and structure of popular songs.  

This tool can be used in the music industry by artists associated with it ranging from lyricists, singers and music directors.

"Lately you have been asking me
If all my words are true
Don't you know I'll do anything for you
Sometimes I haven't been good to you
Sometimes I've made you cry
And I am sorry for everything
But I promise you girl
I promise you this
When the blue night is over my face
On the dark side of the world in space
When I'm all alone with the stars above
You are the one I love
So there's no need to worry girl
My heart is sealed for you
And no one's gonna take it away
Cos' I promise you girl
I promise you this
When the blue night is over my face
On the dark side of the world in space
When I'm all alone with the stars above
You are the one I love
Your voice is calling to me in my dreams
My love is stronger than it's ever been"

I was sittin' on a bar stool
In a barbecue joint in Tennessee
When this old boy walked in
And he sat right down next to me
I could tell he'd been through some hard times
'Cause there were tear stains on his old shirt
And he said, you wanna know what you get
When you play a country song backwards
You get your house back
You get your dog back
You get your best friend Jack back
You get your truck back
You get your hair back
You get your first and second jobs back
Your front porch swing
Your bling, bling, bling and a diamond ring
You get your farm, and the barn
And the boat, and the Harley
And that old black cat named Charlie
It sounds a little crazy
A little scattered and absurd
But that's what you get
When you play a country song backwards
Well, I never heard it said quite like that
It hit me in the face 'cause that's where I'm at
I almost fell flat out on the floor
He said, wait a minute, that's not all
There's even more
You get your mind back
You get your nerves back
Your achy breaky heart
You get your pride back
You get your life back
You get your first real love back
You get your big screen TV, a DVD
And a washing machine
You get the pond, and the lawn
The breaker, and the mower
You go back where you don't know her
It sounds a little crazy
A little scattered and absurd
But that's what you get
When you play a country song backwards
Oh play that song!
We sat there and talked
About how it would be
If we could turn it all around
And go back T-I-M-E
You get your house back
You get your dog back
You get your best friend Jack back
You get your truck back
You get your hair back
You get your first and second job back
Your front porch swing
Your bling, bling, bling and a diamond ring
You get your farm, and the barn
And the boat, and the Harley
And that old black cat named Charlie
You get your mind back
You get your nerves back
Your achy breaky heart
You get your pride back
You get your life back
You get your first real love back
You get your big screen TV, a DVD
And a washing machine
You get the pond, and the lawn
The breaker, and the mower
You go back when life was slower
It sounds a little crazy
A little scattered and absurd
But that's what you get
When you play a country song backwards
