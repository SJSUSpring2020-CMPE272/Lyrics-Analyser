# Project Idea-1
1. Project Title
Viral News Classifier

2. Project idea description
We are interested to figure out if the popular news articles out on the world wide web have some common characteristics and traits. By treating this as a classification problem, we endeavor to identify these properties that make a news article go viral. Identifying the underlying factors which influence popularity dynamics is crucial in today’s increasingly digitized world in which more readers obtain information from online sources, rather than print sources. The goal of this project is to identify the characteristics that make a news article go viral. 

3. Goal of the project (who are you developing the project for)
This would be most useful for anybody who publishes content on the web; most notably content publishers, bloggers and news agencies.  Online marketing and advertising agencies also would like to know which articles have the chances of becoming viral to maximize their earning potential.

4. Technology stack
We will utilize a dataset from University of California, Irvine consisting of 39,644 randomly chosen articles from the online media website “Mashable”. The data consists of 61 variables involving shares and characteristics of news.

We will utilize R as our primary language for massaging this dataset and to run various ML algorithms including KNN, random forest and a few others to figure out which algorithm provides the best results in a reasonable amount of time.

For the front end, we will create a website and host it either on AWS/GCP/R Studio cloud and attempt to display the comparisons of the different ML algorithms used along with some visualizations around the data itself.


# Project Idea-2

1. Project Title 
Musical Lyrics Analysis 
 
 
2. Project idea description 
The project is based on natural language processing over the existing lyrical dataset of over 5000+ popular songs and then using machine learning algorithms to generate a prediction model for guessing popularity of new songs based on keywords extracted from the lyrical dataset. The prediction model will be based upon the data extracted from already hit songs and will try to estimate the popularity of new songs based upon song’s length, repetition of words, usage of pop culture keywords. 
 
  
3. The goal of the project ( Targeted User) 
This tool can be used in the music industry by artists associated with it ranging from lyricists, singers and music directors. 
 
 
4. Technology stack 
We will utilize an open source dataset from Kaggle website, consisting of 5000+ popular hit songs from various genres and timescale. The data consists of many variables like performing artist, genre, total word length, year of release. We will utilize Python as our primary language and associated sci-kit learning, matplotlib (numPy) module for massaging this dataset stored in MySQL database. 
 
We will run existing ML algorithms from the extracted dataset and try to figure out which algorithm provides the best results in a reasonable amount of time. 
 
Based upon the technical difficulties and time limits, we will try to develop front end for the program and host it on cloud services like AWS/GCP and attempt to display the comparisons of the different ML algorithms used along with some visualizations around the data itself. 

# Project Idea-3

1. Project Title
Food for everyone
2. Project idea description
The idea is to build a web application where if someone or some restaurant has leftover food(s), they can add details and anyone who is interested can come and collect/buy it. We will provide various important fields which will help interested buyers choose what they want. 
Further, using machine learning we can predict in which area people are likely to have more food at a lower price, using data and past trends.
3. Goal of the project (who are you developing the project for)
The goal of the project is to aid in avoidance of food wastage. The app will provide a simple interface for users to quickly check availability of food in their neighborhood using maps. They can also schedule a pick up time and pay using credits or cash. Further extension of this idea is to have a credit based system. The person giving food can earn credits that can be used later to get food from others.

4. Technology stack
React, Javascript, Nodejs, mysql, R.
